- Removing Trailing Slashes: Standardize URLs by removing unnecessary trailing slashes, ensuring uniformity across different URL variations.

- Extracting Paths: Parse URLs to extract and normalize the path segments, enabling easier comparison and manipulation.

- Parsing HTML for URLs: Extract URLs from HTML content, normalize them, and ensure they conform to the desired format.
